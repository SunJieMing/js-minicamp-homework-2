# Homework #2

## Instructions
---
1. Feynman Writing Prompts - Write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.

	* `for` = We use for loops to repeat an action a certain amount of times.
	* `&&`, `||`, `!` = && is the and operator and is used to check if two conditions are evaluated to true. Both conditions must be true when using the && operator for it to execute. || is the or operator and is used to check if either of the conditions are true. One condition can be true and one false and it will still return true when using the or operator. ! is used for indicating that something is the opposite. So !true would be false and !false would be true.
	* Arrays = Arrays are lists that can be stored to a single variable using multiple strings instead of assigning only one string to a variable.
	* Git = A version control system to keep track of changes in our files and also making collaborating work with other people easier.
	* GitHub = A website used to store code files. It's the "HUB" for Git. 


2. Install git.  https://git-scm.com/downloads


3. Fork and clone this repo.  When you need to commit use the following commands.

	* `git status`
	* `git add --all`
	* `git status`
	* `git commit -m "your commit message"`
	* `git push origin master`


4. Make the tests pass!
