	* for loop
	A structure that repeats a block of statements a certain amount of times. It has a counter variable, a test condition, and it increases or decreases the counter variable every time it loops.
        The for loop repeats the block of statements as long as the test condition is true. It checks the test condition each time it wants to loop, and if the condition evaluates to true, the for loop 
        executes the block of statements, increases or decreases the counter variable, and then rechecks the test condition. 
	* && || !
&& is logical AND. It returns true when both expressions or statements on each side of it evaulte to true, otherwise it returns false.
|| is logical OR. It returns true whenever at least one of the expression or statements is true.
	* Array
An array is a list of elements. An array is zero based. So to access it's first element you must use 0 as the index, to access it's second element use the index 1, and so on.
	* git
Git is a version control system. It allows a group of people to work on the same code at the same time without creating conflicts from their changes that would happen in a normal workflow.
	* GitHub
Github is the online code storage area that git uses for its version control.
