    for

	A for loop is used to repeat some code a specified number of times. You create an indexing variable at the
	beginning of every for loop, and increment it each time you go through the loop. You check whether the
	indexing variable is at the end or less than a certain number to see if you want to keep looping. Inside
	the for loop you can use the indexing variable to access elements of an array, or to do calculations.

    &&, ||, !

	The && symbol means "and". You can use && to see if multiple expressions are true at the same time.
	It is like asking, "Is this true && this true?" If one of the expressions is false, the whole thing will
	return false. The || symbol means "or". When you use ||, you are asking whether either one of the expressions
	is true. "true || false" would evaluate to true. The ! symbol means "not". Not is used to flip the value
	of a boolean. !true would be false, and !false would be true.

    Arrays

	Arrays are sequences of variables. Storing things in a sequence is one way to organize data. Organizing your
	data helps you work with it more easily and more efficiently. If I hold 1, 2, and 3 in an array, I can loop
	through the array and access all those elements individually. If I just held those values in variables I
	would have to manually type out all of the variable names to access each value. You can see how that
	would get cumbersome if I had many different values to work with.

    Git

	Git is a command line tool that helps you organize and share files in a way that allows developers to easily
	work together on large projects and manage multiple versions more easily.

    GitHub

	GitHub is the website associated with Git. You can browse people's repositories, make your own copies of
	their repositories, and submit requests to have changes you make incorporated into the owner's repository.
