# Feynman Writing Prompts

Write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.

##My Definitions:

1.  `for`: for loops allow you run each individual element in an array through one or more functions all at once, rather than having to input those individual elements one at a time.
2.  `&&`, `||`, `!`: In writing conditional statements && allows you to combine two parameters (ex. if this AND that are true), || represents OR, and ! negates whatever it is in front of (ex. if food = ‘Pizza’ then return true otherwise return false--> then !food = ‘Pizza’ will print false).
3.  Arrays: Arrays are like a more sophisticated version of a list.  They make adding, subtracting, manipulating and finding specific elements in that list much easier.  The values inside an array are called “elements”, and are each separated by a comma.  Brackets [] are used to contain an array of elements.
4.  Git: Git is the version control software that comprises all Git repositories.  GitHub is one of many hosting services that allows you to work with Git repositories.  Version Control: Imagine that you are assigned to write a paper with a thousand other people.  How would you do it?  Git is a solution that makes writing programs with thousands of other people possible.
5.  GitHub: GitHub is an online cloud based website service that uses Git to allow people from all of the world to work together on the same programs in an organized and efficient way.
