for loop: A for loop is a way to "iterate" through a range of numbers, starting at
any integer and ending with any integer, and counting by any integer. You could have
a for loop that starts at 12 and counts by 5 all the way to 72. Technically it would
not be conventional, but it would be possible. You can use the values in the loop to
access other information, such as array items by index. This would be more work to have
a value of 34 for i and have to subtract 34 to access the first element, but it is
possible.

&& || !: The symbol used for the "and" condition is "&&." This is used in loops, to signify
that two or more conditions are met. For example, with "var x = 5," if you said x > 3 && x < 10,
it would be true. The same goes for || (or) and ! (not). The or symbol will evaluate that at least
1 of several conditions are met. Also, the symbol for not evaluates whether a condition is not met.

Array: An array is alist of items, that are ordered with each each item having its own index.
The indexing system in JavaScript (and in most other, if not all programming languages) actually
starts with 0, as opposed to 1, like common sense would tell a non-programmer. It is something that
should be kept in mind, so that incorrect values aren't accidentally referenced in code.

Git: Git is a system that functions as version control. One is able to upload to Github and
use Git in the terminal, etc., and it is the medium through which code updates are made to
the master file.

Github: Github is a website that makes it possible to upload projects to the
internet to have them edited by several developers. One can host a project and
have corrections requested/reviewed before approval, which is a convenient and
reliable way to safeguard against vandalism to a project. Also, having an open
source project means that it can be edited by anybody who wants to do so. This
also gives developers a means to gain experience and show potential employers
that they know what they're doing.
