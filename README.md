# Homework #2

## Instructions
---
1. Feynman Writing Prompts - Write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.
		
	* for loop
		The 'for loop' is one of the many iteration statements available for use in Javascript. There are other ones like the 'while loop', 'do...while' loop and a few others. Iteration statements or looping methods offer a way for you to do something repeatedly in your code. Loops basically just repeat some action or event a number of times.

		A for loop repeats a certain action until a certain condition becomes false. The construct of a for loop involves specifying a 'loop control'. This is usually a number or condition that will be used to control how many times the 'for loop' will run. To create a 'for loop', a 'loop control' is initialized, evaluated, and incremented. The loop will continue to run until the loop control evaluates to false or it gets to its limit.
		
		 For example, you can create a 'for loop' to print out "hello nana" 4 times. With this, you will initialize a loop control, let's say 'i = 0'. You then say while the value of 'i'(1) is less than 4  (the number of times you want to print 'hello nana' out), the loop should print out the text. At every print, the 'loop control' i.e i=1 will be increased by 1. This loop will therefore stop executing when the value of 1 is equal to 4.

	* && || !

		In Javascript, and in most other languages, these are referred to as logical operators. They 'operate' on an expression and 'return' a boolean value (true or false), to determine whether the statement is true or false. 

		'&&' is known as the LOGICAL AND. When this is used for two expressions, it means that, all the expressions on both sides should evaluate to true before the statement whole statement can be deemed 'true'. 			
		Example, You can play the game only when "you have done your chores && taken your supper". For this to return true, you must have done your chores and taken your supper. Not one, both.


		'||' is the LOGICAL OR operator. When used to evaluate 2 expressions, only one side of the expression needs to be true for this operator to return a 'true' value. if both are true, the || operator returns a 'false' value.
		Therefore, in our gaming example above, in order to be allowed to play the game, you must have either taken your supper or done your chores. Any of them is sufficient.
		

		'!' is the LOGICAL NOT operator. Unlike the others, this is normally used on a single operand. In plain language, you might use it to do something like. If Nana is NOT bad, maintain him in the team.


	* Array
		An array is a series or list of values in a program or code that have the same name and also belong to the same data type. Each value in an array has an index that allows that particular item to be called or retrieved from the array. For example, a 'Restaurant Menu' program can use an array to list the various Pizza types that they are offering on a day.

	* git
		Software programs can contain thousands and more lines of code. It is necessary to be able to track changes you make in your code. Thats where git comes in.
		
		Git is an open-source version control system.It is one of the more popular ones. Other ones include SVN and Mercurial.
		 A version control system records changes to a file(s) over time so that you can recall the state of the file at any point in time. Version control simply just allows you to take 'snapshots' of how a file looked like at a particular point in time. This allows a programmer to be able to go back and review the state of the file at every one of those 'snapshots'.

	* GitHub
		GitHub is a website/platform that allow allows software developers around the world to collaborate on coding projects. One person can be in Azerbajan and another in Zimbabwe and can be working on the same software project. GitHub will allow them to host the code of the project they are working on, on the GitHub platform. This can enable both of them to review each others code, track changes made by the other party, submit issues found in the code etc, all on centralized platform. 
		GitHub is built on top of the git version control system.


2. Install git.  https://git-scm.com/downloads


3. Fork and clone this repo.  When you need to commit use the following commands.
		
	* git status
	* git add --all
	* git status
	* git commit -m "your commit message"
	* git push origin master


4. Make the tests pass!
